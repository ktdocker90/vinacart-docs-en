Using SSL HTTPS
=================

To use SSL https, enter the URL into the "Secure Store URL" field on the "setting / setting / details" settings page. Note: "Store URL" and "Secure Store URL" field must be the same domain.
For example: http://shop.vn & https://www.shop.vn are two different domain names, distinguishing subdomain (www).

Use .htaccess. You want to redirect non-https to https, adding the following line to your .htaccess file.
